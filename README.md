Hello There,
Greetings! I am MD. Nahid Hasan Tamim. I am from Bangladesh.

Integrity and Humbleness are the two main traits that I am built upon. Beyond that, I am someone who knows how to set goals and achieve them, and have a proven track record of being able to conceive, develop & execute strategies. I firmly believe that my communication & interpersonal skills coupled with my ability to improvise are few things I can offer to anyone who desires my assistance.
 
Currently I am employed as Senior Executive Programmer in Swiss Tex Group, a group of export oriented ready-made garment accessories manufacturing company established in 1995. Here, I am working on several web development projects along with an in-house developed ERP system. Before that I worked in The City Bank Limited as an MIS Officer, where I learnt the true meaning of professional life as that was the place where my career began.
My objective in the work life is to learn new things and combine them with the knowledge and experience that I have gathered earlier. This way I can expand my expertise so that I can do even more challenging and interesting new tasks or advance further on my career.

I have experience in web development. For web development my skill-sets are as follows:
a). Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
b). Backend: PHP, C#.
c). Database: MySQL, SqlServer, Oracle(Fundamentals).
d) Frameworks: Bootstrap, Laravel, React, Asp.Net.

Tools: Ms Office applications, Visual Studio, VS Code , Photoshop, NetBeans, Sublime, Notepad++, Unity, etc
